# Package Managers

Throughout this page, we will describe how to compile the example file `example.cpp` below.

```cpp
--8<-- "integration/example.cpp"
```

When executed, this program should create output similar to

```json
--8<-- "examples/meta.output"
```

## Homebrew

!!! abstract "Summary"

    formula: [**`nlohmann-json`**](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/nlohmann-json)

    - :octicons-tag-24: Availalbe versions: current version and development version (with `--HEAD` parameter)
    - :octicons-rocket-24: The formula is updated with every release.
    - :octicons-person-24: Maintainer: Niels Lohmann
    - :octicons-file-24: File issues at the [Homebrew issue tracker](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues)
    - :octicons-question-24: [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh)

If you are using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), you can install the library with

```sh
brew install nlohmann-json
```

The header can be used directly in your code or via CMake.

??? example "Example: Raw compilation"

    1. Create the following file:

        ```cpp title="example.cpp"
        --8<-- "integration/homebrew/example.cpp"
        ```

    2. Install the package:

        ```sh
        brew install nlohmann-json
        ```

    3. Compile the code and pass the Homebrew prefix to the include path such that the library can be found:

        ```sh
        c++ example.cpp -I$(brew --prefix nlohmann-json)/include -std=c++11 -o example
        ```

??? example "Example: CMake"

    1. Create the following files:

        ```cpp title="example.cpp"
        --8<-- "integration/homebrew/example.cpp"
        ```

        ```cmake title="CMakeLists.txt"
        --8<-- "integration/homebrew/CMakeLists.txt"
        ```

    2. Install the package:

        ```sh
        brew install nlohmann-json
        ```

    3. Compile the code and pass the Homebrew prefix to CMake to find installed packages via `#!cmake find_package`:

        ```sh
        CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(brew --prefix) cmake -S . -B build
        cmake --build build
        ```

## Meson

!!! abstract "Summary"

    wrap: **`nlohmann_json`**

    - :octicons-tag-24: Availalbe versions: current version and select older versions (see
      [WrapDB](https://mesonbuild.com/Wrapdb-projects.html))
    - :octicons-rocket-24: The package is update automatically from file
      [`meson.build`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/meson.build).
    - :octicons-file-24: File issues at the [library issue tracker](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues)
    - :octicons-question-24: [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/index.html)

If you are using the [Meson Build System](http://mesonbuild.com), add this source tree as a [meson subproject](https://mesonbuild.com/Subprojects.html#using-a-subproject). You may also use the
`include.zip` published in this project's [Releases](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases) to reduce the size of the vendored source tree. Alternatively,
you can get a wrap file by downloading it from [Meson WrapDB](https://mesonbuild.com/Wrapdb-projects.html), or simply
use

```shell
meson wrap install nlohmann_json
```

Please see the Meson project for any issues regarding the packaging.

The provided `meson.build` can also be used as an alternative to CMake for installing `nlohmann_json` system-wide in
which case a pkg-config file is installed. To use it, simply have your build system require the `nlohmann_json`
pkg-config dependency. In Meson, it is preferred to use the
[`dependency()`](https://mesonbuild.com/Reference-manual.html#dependency) object with a subproject fallback, rather than
using the subproject directly.

??? example "Example: Wrap"

    1. Create the following files:

        ```ini title="meson.build"
        --8<-- "integration/meson/meson.build"
        ```

        ```cpp title="example.cpp"
        --8<-- "integration/meson/example.cpp"
        ```

    2. Use the Meson WrapDB to fetch the nlohmann/json wrap:

        ```shell
        mkdir subprojects
        meson wrap install nlohmann_json
        ```

    3. Build:

        ```shell
        meson setup build
        meson compile -C build
        ```

## Bazel

!!! abstract "Summary"

    use `http_archive`, `git_repository`, or `local_repository`

    - :octicons-tag-24: Any version, as version is specified in `WORKSPACE` file
    - :octicons-file-24: File issues at the [library issue tracker](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues)
    - :octicons-question-24: [Bazel website](https://bazel.build)

This repository provides a [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) `WORKSPACE.bazel` and a corresponding `BUILD.bazel` file. Therefore, this
repository can be referenced by workspace rules such as `http_archive`, `git_repository`, or `local_repository` from
other Bazel workspaces. To use the library you only need to depend on the target `@nlohmann_json//:json` (e.g., via
`deps` attribute).

??? example

    1. Create the following files:

        ```ini title="BUILD"
        --8<-- "integration/bazel/BUILD"
        ```

        ```ini title="WORKSPACE"
        --8<-- "integration/bazel/WORKSPACE"
        ```

        ```cpp title="example.cpp"
        --8<-- "integration/bazel/example.cpp"
        ```

    2. Build and run:

        ```shell
        bazel build //:main
        bazel run //:main
        ```

## Conan

!!! abstract "Summary"

      [Conan Center](https://conan.io/center/recipes/nlohmann_json))
    - :octicons-rocket-24: The package is update automatically via
      [this recipe](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/tree/master/recipes/nlohmann_json).
    - :octicons-file-24: File issues at the [Conan Center issue tracker](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/issues)
    - :octicons-question-24: [Conan website](https://conan.io)

If you are using [Conan](https://www.conan.io/) to manage your dependencies, merely add `nlohmann_json/x.y.z` to your `conanfile`'s
requires, where `x.y.z` is the release version you want to use.

??? example

    1. Create the following files:

        ```ini title="Conanfile.txt"
        --8<-- "integration/conan/Conanfile.txt"
